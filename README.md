Certainly! Here's a README for the ChargePredictor class:

# ChargePredictor

## Overview

ChargePredictor is a Python class designed to predict charge levels for industrial or organizational systems. It uses a combination of historical data analysis and machine learning techniques to provide accurate predictions for future dates.
The coding has proven 92% accuracy with an OOB score of 90.232% a formidable score that represents the algorithm understands the underlying patterns presented by the data

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing from CSV files
- Advanced feature engineering including time-based, holiday, and seasonal features
- Historical data analysis for specific dates and time periods
- Day-of-week and monthly average calculations
- Machine learning model (Random Forest) for prediction
- Combination of traditional and ML-based prediction methods
- Visualization of predictions and feature importance

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- holidays (for US holiday detection)

## Key Methods

- `prepare_data()`: Cleans and prepares the data, creating new features.
- `train_ml_model()`: Trains the Random Forest model on the prepared data.
- `make_prediction(target_date_str)`: Makes predictions for a given date using both traditional and ML methods.
- `plot_prediction(target_date_str)`: Plots the predictions and feature importance.
- `analyze_feature_importance()`: Returns a DataFrame of feature importances.

## Data Requirements

The input CSV file should contain at least the following columns:
- 'Time': Datetime column
- 'Workable': Target variable for prediction

## Notes

- The class uses a combination of historical data, day-of-week averages, monthly averages, and machine learning predictions to generate final predictions.
- Predictions are weighted: 63% traditional methods, 37% machine learning.
- The Random Forest model is trained with 150 estimators and a max depth of 10.

## Error Handling

The class includes various error handling mechanisms and prints detailed information for debugging purposes.

## Customization

You can modify the feature engineering process, ML model parameters, or prediction weighting in the source code to suit your specific needs.
- Integration with ledger.py is being worked on and will be commited in the near future with implementation from ALPS
- the integration and implementation of these features will provide real time updates as well as concurrent data collection and ML learning. the ALPS will provide a strong prediction number for the code to adhere to while working to create the combined prediction.
